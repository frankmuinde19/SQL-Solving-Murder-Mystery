## SQL-Solving-Murder-Mystery
In this project, I cracked a murder case in SQL City using only SQL queries.It began with a mysterious crime on January 15, 2018, and two eyewitnesses — one living on Northwestern Dr, the other named Annabel on Franklin Ave — pointed me toward the local gym.

Clue by clue, I filtered through gym memberships, security footage, and check-in logs to narrow it down to two suspects. A key detail — a partial license plate, “H42W” — led me to the killer: Jeremy Bowers.

But the mystery didn’t end there...

A final interview revealed he was just the hired hand. Using details like height, hair color, car model, and concert attendance, I tracked the real mastermind:
Miranda Priestly — red-haired, Tesla-driving, symphony-loving villainess.

With SQL, I unraveled the entire plot and brought the murderer and the mastermind to justice.
Case closed!

Tools used: JOIN, GROUP BY, LIKE, CTEs, logical filters, and classic detective intuition — all in SQL!
