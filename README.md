## SQL-Solving-Murder-Mystery
I completed the SQL Murder Mystery, an interactive project that blended SQL learning with crime-solving. 
It was a fun way to reinforce my SQL skills and a creative challenge to analyze data and solve a fictional murder case in SQL City. 
Using SQL queries, I uncovered clues, followed leads, and ultimately cracked the case.

It began with a mysterious crime on January 15, 2018, and two eyewitnesses — one living on Northwestern Dr, the other named Annabel on Franklin Ave — pointed me toward the local gym.

Clue by clue, I filtered through gym memberships, security footage, and check-in logs to narrow it down to two suspects. A key detail — a partial license plate, “H42W” — led me to the killer: Jeremy Bowers.

But the mystery didn’t end there...

A final interview revealed he was just the hired hand. Using details like height, hair color, car model, and concert attendance, I tracked the real mastermind:
Miranda Priestly — red-haired, Tesla-driving, symphony-loving villainess.

With just SQL, I unraveled the entire plot and brought both the murderer and the mastermind to justice.
